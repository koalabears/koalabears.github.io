###Summary
- Website needs to be worked on continuously, as we upload future project details.

###Lessons Learned:
- A 2-day sprint is short. Very short. Work on completing the basic outline structure and design before considering details.
- Delete Jekyll's files and work on a clean slate - the original css files were confusing and difficult to follow. Next time, start anew.
- Comment files so that they make sense to anyone and everyone.
- Consider dedicating CCS to one person? Making sure the margins, etc. and where they are set, can get a bit confusing otherwise.

###Future Improvements:
- Make it work for mobile - use media-query to make margins, text-sizes, etc. responsive.
- Experiment with blog-text colour, font, etc.
- Experiment with scrolling features,
- Add a 'Blog' tab, 'search-box', "read more" button for the blogs, project list, etc.
- Link the 'Blog' and 'Projects' tabs.
